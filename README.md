# webdsls
An experiment to build MPS-based stacks of DSLs for common web languages (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ...)

Our first milestone is to provide "reasonable" base-language implementations + small modular extensions to make the life easier. 
Longer term goal is to develop modular domain specific stacks of DSLs.

Current status (rough estimation, feedback welcomed):
- HTML - ca. 50%
- JavaScript - ca. 50%
- CSS - ca. 50%
